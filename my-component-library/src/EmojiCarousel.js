 ** In this exercise you'll transition between two emojis: sad and happy
 ** You should have a happy state which will be a boolean denoting whether or not the emoji should
 ** be happy or sad.
 ** The emojis should transition from opacity: 0 to opacity: 1
 ** The button text should change depending upon the happy state: "Make sad" if currently happy and "Make happy" if currently sad
